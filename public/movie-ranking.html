<h2>Here are my top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />

<h3>School of Rock</h3>
<p>This movie is all about the passion for music and I definitely recommend every musician to watch it.</p>

<h3>Charlie and The Chocolate Factory</h3>
<p>Still can't understand how Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka but the movie is so well made.</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda 3</h3>
<p>It's so motivational that you will be tempted to start working towards your goals instantly or even do Kung Fu.</p>
